# Google Translate Randomizer

A small Python script that randomizes a given text by translating it in every language google knows.

## Usage

```main.py <inputfile> <outputfile> <original_language> <iterations>```

Note to the Iterations: I recommend to use 20-30 for the best results. Higher numbers can cause dataloss.

## Example

The original text is a part of an recipe: ```First, mix together the dry and wet ingredients in two separate bowls. Combine the sugar, flour, powdered sugar, cocoa powder, chocolate chips, and salt in a medium bowl. Then, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, and water in a large one.
Next, combine the wet and dry ingredients. Sprinkle the dry mixture over the wet one, and fold until just combined. The batter will be thick!
Then, pour the batter into an 8×8 inch baking pan lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to spread it to all four sides of the pan and to smooth the top. The mixture will be very thick – that’s ok.```

Now I used my script with 30 itrerations:

### 1st Result

```First, combine patience and effort. In a large bowl, combine the sugar, sugar, flour, flour, cocoa powder, chocolate and bleach. Add the eggs, oil and water after mixing. And mix slowly to dry. Add more oil until it is hot. talk to me! Now prepare the veil for 8 x 8 grams of meat. Place the plastic spoon in the bowl and continue. Mix well ```

### 2nd Result

```First, pour 1 glass of water into 2 bowls. Mix sugar and flour in a large bowl. Add 1 tbsp and 1 tbsp flour. Add salt. Next result. Add enough oil and water. Loaded and mixed. Mix the dry mixture with water. Next, the Pipzo mixture kneaded the dough from 8% with a red spoon on both sides of the oven. The dough is heavy, but not half. ```

### 3rd Result with 20 iterations

```Go through the first two bars. We create the beauty of bread and chocolate, then add the eggs. Combine olive oil with water. Then add the dried fruit. When the oil is mixed with the oil. Removing reduces your oil. Add "8 by 8" documents. Use the blue button to clean the floor. It will be a very powerful combination. ```
